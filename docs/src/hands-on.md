## Step-by-step Experiment

Here, we retrace the experiments implemented [in this article](assets/articles/time2025.pdf).

They are related to body tracking; in particular, we want to describe the movement of [NATOPS dataset](https://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=NATOPS).

TODO - retrace the experiments for TIME 2025

## Implementing a new meaningfulness measure
TODO - implement a new measure, leveraging @localmemo and @globalmemo, and explaining what optimizations they introduce.

## Writing a new mining algorithm
TODO - Write a new mining algorithm (e.g., Eclat)

## Write a new AbstractMiner
TODO - E.g., to implement an heuristic approach such as NSGA-II.
