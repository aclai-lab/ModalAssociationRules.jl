Organization:
  ☐ uniform algorithms interface (fit)
  ☐ think about which parameters are needed and how they can be customized
    # maybe a configuration structure with an array of local measures?
    # also, each measure can be activated locally or globally
    # localdict{string(local measure) -> counter} # if local measure is given
    # globldict{string(local measure) -> counter} # if local measure is given with globality on
  ☐ write an initial apriori implementation
  ☐ write an initial fpgrowth implementation

Testing:
  ☐ in test section, invoke SoleLogics kripke models generation
    ✔ write SoleLogics kripke models generation @done(23-12-20 18:34)
  ☐ prepare an array of frequent literals (both locally and globally)
  ☐ test the initial apriori implementation (see organization section)
  ☐ test the initial fpgrowth implementation (generated rules must be the same as in apriori)
