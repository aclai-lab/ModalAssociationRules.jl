This folder contains the benchmarking of (the modal adaptations of) Apriori, FPGrowth, and Eclat algorithms.

You can configure the experiment by tweaking the `config.json`, and see the output times in the `results` subfolder.

`results-plotter.jl` is just a utility script used for generating one of the plots within the submission for *Expert Systems with Applications*.
